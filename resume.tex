\section*{Experience}

\begin{list1}

\item \begin{tabular1bold} Lyft, Software Engineer; Seattle, WA & March 2018 -- Present \end{tabular1bold}

  \begin{list2}
  \item Working on a small and diverse team developing alternative (to cars) transportation options and multimodal journey planning within Lyft
  \item Shipped transit journey planning, appearing alongside car options in several large metro areas \hfill\emph{Python}
  \item Designed, developed, and shipped a feature allowing users to perform geospatial search and access realtime nearby transit information. This feature has been highlighted in \href{https://www.wired.com/story/lyft-public-transit-app-zimmer-santa-monica/}{Wired} and \href{https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-19/lyft-is-adding-new-york-subway-info-to-app-even-as-it-fights-with-the-city}{Bloomberg}. \hfill\emph{Python}
  \item One of three engineers developing a novel routing engine which can compute multimodal journeys in transit dense regions in $<$50ms. I am personally responsible for developing components to manage transportation network data structures and realtime updates with concurrent access. Our work has resulted in a pending patent. \hfill\emph{Go}
  \end{list2}

\item \begin{tabular1bold} Teachers Pay Teachers, Software Engineer; New York, NY & Sep 2016 -- Feb 2018 \end{tabular1bold}

  \item Marketplace for teachers to buy and sell teaching materials

  \item Backend system component development \hfill\emph{Elixir/Phoenix}

    \begin{list3}
    \item Architected and developed a distributed asynchronous task processor backed by Redis
    \item Redesigned feature toggle updates, decreasing update time from $\sim$10mins to $<$30secs
    \end{list3}

  \item Created a continuous integration and deployment pipeline for containers deployed to Kubernetes \hfill\emph{Groovy}
  \item Wrote an internal web application to centralize the deployment process for all applications \hfill\emph{Elixir}
  \item Automated infrastructure management \hfill\emph{Chef, Terraform}
  \end{list2}

\item \begin{tabular1bold} Venmo, Software Engineer; New York, NY & May 2015 -- Aug 2016 \end{tabular1bold}

    \begin{list3}
    \item Improved system reliability and scalability by optimizing MySQL, Mongo, and Cassandra database access
    \end{list3}

  \item Improved the state of developer tooling and increased development velocity \hfill \emph{Python, Packer, Bash}

    \begin{list3}
    \item Owned upkeep and release of development virtual machine
    \item Eliminated most test state issues by replacing legacy static test fixtures with dynamic data creation
    \end{list3}

  \item Improved monitoring/logging/alerting systems and managed infrastructure \hfill \emph{Puppet}
  \item Developed a deep fondness for emojis
  \end{list2}

\item \begin{tabular1bold} Recurse Center, Recurser; New York, NY &  Jan 2015 -- Mar 2015 \end{tabular1bold}

  \begin{list2}
  \item A self described ``retreat for programmers'' \href{https://recurse.com}{(\emph{recurse.com})} where I talked about, read about, and programmed computers. Also played a lot of chess.
  \end{list2}

\item \begin{tabular1bold} University of Vermont Medical Center, Research Assistant; Burlington, VT & May 2013 -- Dec 2014 \end{tabular1bold}
